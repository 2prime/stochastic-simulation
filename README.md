# Stochastic Simulation
These are my course projects of Stochastic Simulation in Peking University. Please refer to Professor Li's [website](http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~tieli/) for more project details. If you have any problems, please contact me with **yangwhsms@gmail.com**
## Project 1
Just run the following command:

`$ ipython project1/main.py`

The default number of workers is 32. Please change the number of workers according to your machine's threading number before you run this file.

## Project 6
There are three simulation methods 'Euler-Maruyama', 'Milstein scheme' and 'Multilevel Monte Carlo'. The first two method have been implemented in
`$ project6/model.py`
